# About The Project
Managing shared expenses can be a hassle, especially when dealing with multiple people, different currencies, and recurring payments. AhLoanBot was born out of this very problem.

Originally conceived as a solution for tracking and collecting payments from friends for a shared ChatGPT Premium subscription, AhLoanBot automates the process of sending monthly reminders and converting USD to SGD for accurate payments. Instead of manually reminding everyone (and risking awkward follow-ups), this Telegram bot ensures timely notifications, calculates the exchange rate, and streamlines the entire process.

Beyond its original use case, AhLoanBot can be adapted for various debt collection and subscription management scenarios, making it a valuable tool for anyone managing recurring payments in a group setting.

By integrating Telegram Bot API and real-time currency conversion, AhLoanBot demonstrates how simple automation can solve everyday inconveniences efficiently.
